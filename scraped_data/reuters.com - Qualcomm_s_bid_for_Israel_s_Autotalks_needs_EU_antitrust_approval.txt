The V2X technology is key to improving road safety, traffic management and reducing CO2 emissions as well as for the deployment of autonomous vehicles," the Commission said in a statement."It is therefore important to ensure that customers such as original equipment manufacturers or infrastructure managers retain access to V2X technology at competitive prices and conditions."Qualcomm, which announced the planned takeover in May to expand its automotive-related business, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Autotalks makes dedicated chips used in the V2X communications technology sector for manned and driverless vehicles, with a view to improving road safety.Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta Editing by Jason Neely and Mark PotterOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
