Craig Arnold, Eaton chairman and chief executive officer, said, “Achieving quarterly record adjusted earnings marked the end of a very strong first half of the year. Demand across our markets continues to be strong, propelling backlogs to record levels. We’re confident we can achieve our increased guidance for the year and that we remain well positioned to capitalize on reindustrialization in North America and Europe as well as the secular growth drivers of electrification, energy transition and digitalization."
